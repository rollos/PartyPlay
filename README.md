# PartyPlay


A web app that allows users to have a shared queue of youtube videos, with the next video to play being voted on by the community. Choose a room to join, this could be a theme, such as indie rock, or just a place to share random videos with only your friends. Search through youtube for the next video you want to share with the group. Vote on videos that other people have added to the queue, the highest voted video will be the one that everybody in the room will see next!
